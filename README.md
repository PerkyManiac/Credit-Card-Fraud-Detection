## Project Description
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning.  
The objective is to build a classification model using Logistic Regression that can distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions while handling a highly imbalanced dataset.  
The notebook covers data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation using appropriate performance metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is too large to be hosted on GitHub.

You can download it from:

The dataset contains real credit card transactions made by European cardholders and is highly imbalanced, making fraud detection a challenging classification problem.
